IMPORTANT:

modify users.csv to add/change users, modify passwords, etc.  

to generate the passhash for a password, go to the login page and open dev-tools  
do `console.log(await computePasshash("<PLAIN_TEXt_PASSWORD>"))` into the console and it should print out a base64 encoded password.  

**PLEASE** make sure you change the default passwords 
ALL defaults are just frc4669 
 
*ALSO MODIFY host_controller/nginx/conf.d/http/maps.conf so the containers are mapped correctly*
